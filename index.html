          <h2 class="section-heading">tl;dr</h2>

          <p>
            HTTPS is used to prevent intruders from being able to listen to
            communications between you and websites you visit, as well as to
            avoid data being modified without your knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, files obtained by APT are accompanied by their own
            signature which allows your system to check they originated from
            your distribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            These signatures are checked against a small set of trusted keys
            already stored on your computer. Downloaded files are rejected by
            APT if they are signed by an unknown
            key<sup><a href="#footnote-apt-unkown-key">1</a></sup> or are missing
            valid signatures. This ensures that the packages you are
            installing were authorised by your distribution and have not been
            modified or replaced since.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTTPS can not detect if malicious tampering has occurred on the
            disks of the server you are downloading from. There is little
            point "securely" transfering a compromised package.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">But what about privacy?</h2>

          <p>
            HTTPS does not provide meaningful privacy for obtaining packages.
            As an eavesdropper can usually see which hosts you are contacting,
            if you connect to your distribution's mirror network it would be
            fairly obvious that you are downloading updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, even over an encrypted connection it is not difficult
            to figure out which files you are downloading based on the size
            of the transfer<sup><a href="#footnote-tor">2</a></sup>. HTTPS
            would therefore only be useful for downloading from a server that
            also offers other packages of similar or identical size.
          </p>

          <p>
            What's more important is <em>not</em> that your connection is
            encrypted but that the files you are installing haven't been
            modified.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Overly trusting CAs</h2>

          <p>
            There are over 400 "Certificate Authorities" who may issue
            certificates for any domain. Many have poor security
            records and some are even explicitly controlled by
            governments<sup><a href="#footnote-ca">3</a></sup>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means that HTTPS provides little-to-no protection against a
            targeted attack on your distribution's mirror network. You could
            limit the set of valid certificates that APT would accept, but that
            would be be error-prone and unlikely worth the additional hassle
            over the existing public-key scheme.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Why not provide HTTPS anyway?</h2>

          <p>
            Your distribution could cryptographically sign the files using the
            existing scheme and additionally serve the files over HTTPS to
            provide "defense in depth."
          </p>

          <p>
            However, providing a huge worldwide mirror network available over
            SSL is not only a complicated engineering task (requiring the
            secure exchange and storage of private keys), it implies a
            misleading level of security and privacy to end-users as described
            above.
          </p>

          <p>
            A switch to HTTPS would also mean you could not take advantage of
            local proxy servers for speeding up access and would additionally
            prohibit many kinds of peer-to-peer mirroring where files are
            stored on servers not controlled directly by your distribution.
            This would disproportionately affect users in remote locales.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Ah, what about replay attacks?</h2>

          <p>
            One issue with a naïve signing mechanism is that it does not
            guarantee that you are seeing the most up-to-date version of the
            archive.
          </p>

          <p>
            This can lead to a <em>replay attack</em> where an attacker
            substitutes an archive with an
            earlier&mdash;unmodified&mdash;version of the archive. This would
            prevent APT from noticing new security updates which they could
            then exploit.
          </p>

          <p>
            To mitigate this problem, APT archives includes a timestamp after
            which all the files are considered stale<sup><a
            href="#footnote-valid-until">4</a></sup>.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Where can I find out more?</h2>

            <em><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt">SecureAPT</a></em> wiki page.
