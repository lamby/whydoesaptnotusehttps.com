          <h2 class="section-heading">tl;dr</h2>

          <p>
            HTTPS is used to prevent intruders from being able to listen to
            communications between you and websites you visit, as well as to
            avoid data being modified without your knowledge. It is an
            important tool to prevent MitM attacks<sup><a href="#footnote-mitm-attack">5</a></sup>
            and should be used to protect APT repositories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Repository metadata obtained by APT can be accompanied by GPG
            signatures which allows your system to check that the repository
            was generated by a source authorized by your distribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            These signatures are checked against a small set of trusted keys
            already stored on your computer. Downloaded repository metadata is rejected by
            APT if it is signed by an unknown
            key<sup><a href="#footnote-apt-unkown-key">1</a></sup> or are missing
            valid signatures. This ensures that the repository you are
            installing packages from is authorised by your distribution and
            has not been modified or replaced since.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to note that APT does not verify GPG signatures on
            packages themselves, thus GPG signing Debian packages will have no
            meaningful effect for users automatically installing packages with
            aptitude, apt-get, or similar tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTTPS can not detect if malicious tampering has occurred on the
            disks of the server you are downloading from. There is little
            point "securely" transfering a compromised package.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">But what about privacy?</h2>

          <p>
            HTTPS does not provide meaningful privacy for obtaining packages.
            As an eavesdropper can usually see which hosts you are contacting,
            if you connect to your distribution's mirror network it would be
            fairly obvious that you are downloading updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, even over an encrypted connection it is not difficult
            to figure out which files you are downloading based on the size
            of the transfer<sup><a href="#footnote-tor">2</a></sup>.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTTPS does provide protection from replay attacks, which are a
            serious concern for GPG signed APT repositories.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">HTTPS should be provided in addition to GPG signed repository metadata</h2>

          <p>
            Your distribution should cryptographically sign the files using the
            existing scheme and additionally serve the files over HTTPS to
            provide "defense in depth."
          </p>

          <p>
            Providing a huge worldwide mirror network available over SSL is a
            complicated engineering task, but prevents several MitM attacks
            that GPG signed APT repositories are vulnerable to and ensures
            that users of open source software can safely and securely install
            packages and updates.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Ah, what about replay attacks?</h2>

          <p>
            One issue with GPG signing APT repositories is that it does not
            guarantee that you are seeing the most up-to-date version of the
            archive.
          </p>

          <p>
            This can lead to a <em>replay attack</em> where an attacker
            substitutes an archive with an
            earlier&mdash;unmodified&mdash;version of the archive. This would
            prevent APT from noticing new security updates which they could
            then exploit.
          </p>

          <p>
            To mitigate this problem, APT archives includes a timestamp after
            which all the files are considered stale<sup><a
            href="#footnote-valid-until">4</a></sup>, which limits (but does
            not prevent) replay attacks. The best way to protect against
            replay attacks is to always serve APT repositories over HTTPS.
          </p>
